# weatherAnalyzer

## Overview
WeatherAnalyzer is an end-to-end data analytics project that ingests real-time weather data via APIs,
stores and analyzes historical trends, detects extreme weather anomalies,
and forecasts next-day temperature using machine learning.

The project supports multiple cities and demonstrates the complete data pipeline
from data acquisition and preprocessing to visualization and predictive modeling.

## Features
- Real-time weather data collection using Open-Meteo API
- Multi-city weather analysis
- Historical trend visualization
- Anomaly detection for extreme weather conditions
- Machine learning–based temperature prediction using Linear Regression

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Flask (for dashboard)
- Google Colab
- Kaggle Datasets

## Machine Learning
A Linear Regression model is trained on historical weather data to predict
the next-day temperature based on previous trends.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter or Kaggle
3. Run cells sequentially
4. (Optional) Run Flask app for dashboard visualization
